# E-Commerce customers(APP vs Website)
This is an easy comparison using the linear regression model 
we had to see which of the two gives more output company website or an APP
We used a linear model to check which of these to gives more output so that we can focus more than that particular thing.
E-commerce Customers dataset was used to check the comparison we used simple data visualization to make things easier.
We can see the joint plot for the time on APP vs the yearly amount spent.

Also, we compared the length of membership vs time on the APP

lastly, we made the Data frame which clearly showed us that time spent on the app gives the company much more profit(by keep other parameters constant it gives profit of $38.59)
than a website which give only $0.19 profit while membership gives alot with $61.29
and we can also focus on attracting people to take membership.

So, here we came to the conclusion that app gives more profit and website gives least and membership give the most profit
therefore company should focus more on the maintanace of APP than the website
